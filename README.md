Investigated cumulative spending to retrieve transaction details for each card type when spending reached 1,000,000.
Identified the city with the lowest percentage of spend for the Gold card type.
Calculated the percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type.
Evaluated month-over-month growth to find the card and expense type combination with the highest growth in January 2014.
